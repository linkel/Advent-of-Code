## Advent of Code!
A one-man website providing an advent calendar of programming puzzles by Eric Wastl, Advent of Code has been eye-opening in teaching me about Python modules and how much spaghetti code I write. https://adventofcode.com/

I am currently working through the 2018 puzzles, but thought it would also be educational for me to work on the previous years' puzzles. Therefore I am devoting this repository towards my solutions to AoC puzzles.
