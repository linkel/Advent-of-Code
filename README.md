# Advent of Code

This repo holds some of my sloppy solutions for Advent of Code.

Advent of Code is a one-man website providing an advent calendar of programming puzzles by Eric Wastl. It has been eye-opening in teaching me about Python modules and how much spaghetti code I write. https://adventofcode.com/

## 2019

The Hacker News thread for this year's AoC got me to do the Day 1 problem. No guarantees on consistency! Day 15 last year was a big mess and some problems took so much time that I suspect I'll probably also peter off as it approaches Christmas. But for now it's fine if I give it another whirl.

## What I wrote in 2018

I am currently working through the 2018 puzzles, but thought it would also be educational for me to work on the previous years' puzzles. Therefore I am devoting this repository towards my solutions to AoC puzzles.
